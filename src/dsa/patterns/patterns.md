# Problem-Solving Patterns (Theory-First Templates)

## Two Pointers
- Sorted arrays or invariant windows. Move pointers based on comparison of ends.

## Sliding Window
- Maintain window invariant (size or sum/unique constraint). Expand/contract.

## Monotonic Stack/Queue
- Maintain monotonicity to answer next/prev greater/less in O(n).

## Prefix Sums & Differences
- Transform range queries to O(1) with O(n) preprocessing.

## DP Templates
- 1D/2D transitions; base cases; order of evaluation; memo vs tabulation.
