# Python DSA Tutorial (Theory-First Implementations)

This repository teaches data structures and algorithms in Python through theory-first, implementation-focused modules. No problem setsâ€”just clear explanations and clean, idiomatic implementations you can study, run, and extend.

## How to use
- Read the corresponding `docs/` guides for concepts and invariants.
- Open the `src/dsa/` modules to see reference implementations.
- Run and experiment in a Python REPL or small scripts under `scripts/`.

## Roadmap
- Core Data Structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, heaps, union-find
- Trees: binary tree, BST, AVL (rotations), heaps
- Graphs: adjacency list/matrix, BFS/DFS, topological sort
- Algorithms: searching, sorting, shortest paths (Dijkstra), MST (Kruskal/Prim)
- Patterns: two pointers, sliding window, monotonic stack/queue, prefix sums, recursion & DP templates

Everything is implemented in pure Python with clarity and comprehensive docstrings.
