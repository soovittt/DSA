# Binary Search Tree (BST)

- Invariant: left < node < right; inorder traversal yields sorted order.
- Operations: insert, search, delete (with inorder successor).
- Balance: unbalanced BST can degrade to a list; AVL/Red-Black fix height.
- Pitfalls: mishandling delete with two children; duplicate handling policy.
