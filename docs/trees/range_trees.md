# Segment Tree and Fenwick Tree

## Segment Tree
- Power-of-two padded array tree; associative op enables range queries.
- Update and query in O(log n); suitable for custom ops.

## Fenwick Tree
- Compact structure for prefix sums; range via prefix differences.
- Update/add and prefix_sum in O(log n); simpler and memory-light.
