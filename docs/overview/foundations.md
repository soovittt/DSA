# Foundations: How to Study DSA the Right Way

- Purpose: understand invariants, complexity, trade-offs, and correctness before code.
- Invariant: a property that must always hold (e.g., BST: left < node < right).
- Abstractions: ADT (what) vs implementation (how).
- Complexity: Big-O for time & space; amortized analysis (e.g., dynamic array growth).
- Interfaces first: specify operations, pre/post-conditions; then implement & test.
