# Graph Algorithms

- Traversals: BFS (level-order with queue), DFS (recursion/stack); visited set invariant.
- DAG: topological sort via indegrees; detect cycles if not all nodes processed.
- Shortest paths: Dijkstra for non-negative weights; invariant on finalized distances.
- MST: Kruskal (sort edges + union-find), Prim (grow frontier with heap).
